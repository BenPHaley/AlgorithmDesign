While reading through *Algorithm Design*, I decided to complete some of the 
practice problems as programs. I will implement the solutions in more than 
one language to capture the different resources each language has. 

### Outline

##### Chapter 3

This is where I began writing programs for the problems in the book. The
first few programs were written to refresh my memory or start me off with a 
language.
